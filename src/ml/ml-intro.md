# Machine Learning

### Definition

Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence.

$$
\begin{gathered}
\text{data} + \text{algorithms} = \text{results} \\
\text{data} + \text{results} = \text{algorithms}
\end{gathered}
$$

### Neural Networks

It is a learning mechanism of a thinking brain. A neuron is a unit of a neural
network. They send messages to each other back and forth to process a problem
and find a solution at the macro level.

It strengthens the connections that lead to success and reduces the chances
of leading to failure.

##### Perceptrons

-   It is the fundamental of a neural network.
-   It represents a unit neuron with only one input layer.

### Deep Neural Networks

They are made up of many hidden layers of neural networks performing
complex operations on a massive amount of data.

In deep neural networks, input data are processed against a hidden layer and
modified against some more hidden layers to produce a final output.

##### Deep Learning

-   It is a subset of Machine Learning.
-   It is responsible for shaping the modern world's AI.
-   It is used to recognize graphic patterns that are widely used.
